getting pickaxe out of beard:

frame order: 0,1,0,1,2,3,3

notes: 
frames 0 and 1 are repeated because the dwarf is rummaging through his beard.

frame 3 is repeated so he holds his pickaxe aloft longer.
the reason these are set up this way is so that all frames of all animations have the same duration.
makes things easier for both of us.



putting pickaxe back in beard:

frame order: 0,0,1,2

notes:
again, frame 0 is repeated so he holds his pickaxe aloft longer. with only one frame, it looks too abrupt.
