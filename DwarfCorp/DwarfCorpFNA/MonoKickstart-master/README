on GNU/Linux and Mac OSX without depending on a system installation of Mono.

About MonoKickstart
-------------------
Originally developed by Edward Rudd for Bastion, MonoKickstart is a reworking of
the stock generated kickstart code from Mono to easily run C# applications on
*nix platforms. Mac OSX support was added in 2013 for MonoGame-SDL2 titles.

About the precompiled/ Folder
-----------------------------
We have provided a precompiled MonoKickstart application for you to use in your
programs. Included are kick binaries and libmono binaries for Mac OSX and Linux
(both x86 and x86_64, OSX uses Universal Binaries). We have also provided the
C# assemblies needed by MonoGame as well as a "./Kick" script to automatically
choose the right binary for the operating system and architecture.

To use the precompiled MonoKickstart, simply rename the kick.bin.* binaries to
the name of your .exe assembly (for instance, MyGame.bin.x86 starts MyGame.exe).
Additionally, modify "Kick" to run those newly named kick binaries rather than
the generic "kick" name. The name of "Kick" itself can be whatever you like.

If you wish to use additional shared libraries (for instance, libSDL2), simply
add the library to the architecture's lib folder:

Linux (32-bit): lib/
Linux (64-bit): lib64/
Mac OSX (Universal): osx/
