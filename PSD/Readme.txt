This library for loading PSDs was pulled from the project described below. All we did was delete the Paint.Net bits.



Photoshop PSD FileType Plugin for Paint.NET


Description
------------

This plugin allows Paint.NET to load and save Photoshop .PSD files.

Perfect round-trip compatibility is possible for features that are
common to both Paint.NET and Adobe Photoshop.  Other features are
preserved with varying levels of visual fidelity.

Installation
-------------

1. Exit all instances of Paint.NET.
2. Copy Photoshop.dll into the C:\Program Files\Paint.NET\FileTypes
   directory.
3. Restart Paint.NET, which will automatically detect the plugin.
