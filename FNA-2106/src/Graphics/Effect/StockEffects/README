The code found in this folder comes directly from the Stock Effects sample
project, almost exactly as it was published by Microsoft:

http://xbox.create.msdn.com/en-US/education/catalog/sample/stock_effects

The following changes have been made to accommodate the FNA project:

- The 'StockEffects' namespace is now 'Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics'.
	- The unnecessary using statements have consequently been removed.
- SpriteEffect is an internal class, rather than public, for XNA4 accuracy.
- OnApply() uses the 'internal' keyword, to match the internal XNA4 API.

What we do NOT use in FNA is the embedded resource classes found in the example.

Instead, we created our own 'Resources' class, found in src/Graphics/Effects/.
