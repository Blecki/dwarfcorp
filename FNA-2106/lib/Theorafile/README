About Theorafile
----------------
Theorafile was written to be used for FNA's VideoPlayer. We access this library
via Theorafile#, which you can find in the 'csharp/' directory.

Dependencies
------------
Theorafile depends solely on the C runtime. libogg, libvorbis, and libtheoradec
are statically linked into Theorafile.

Theorafile's "sdl2test" test program requires SDL2.
