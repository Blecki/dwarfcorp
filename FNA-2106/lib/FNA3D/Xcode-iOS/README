Building FNA3D for iOS/tvOS
---------------------------
FNA3D uses Xcode to build on iOS and tvOS.

Dependencies
------------
Before building, download SDL2's source code from SDL's website:

http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php

After extracting the zip file, be sure to rename the directory to remove the
version number (for example, 'SDL2-2.0.8' should be 'SDL2').

Compiling
---------
1. Build SDL2/Xcode-iOS/SDL/SDL.xcodeproj
2. Build FNA3D.xcodeproj
3. Grab libFNA3D.a and libSDL2.a, ship it!
