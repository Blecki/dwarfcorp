Building FNA3D for Windows
--------------------------
FNA3D uses Visual Studio 2010 to build on Windows.

TODO: REMOVE C RUNTIME DEPENDENCY!

Dependencies
------------
Before building, download SDL2's VC development libraries from SDL's website:

http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php

Extract the ZIP file's SDL2 directory (called something like 'SDL2-2.0.8') as
a sibling to your FNA3D checkout and rename it to 'SDL2', so that you have
directories named 'FNA3D' and 'SDL2' next to each other.

Compiling
---------
1. Build FNA3D.sln
2. Grab the output DLL along with SDL2.dll, ship it!
